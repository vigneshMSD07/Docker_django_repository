#how can create a  image of our django  project

add this line to the docker file
FROM django:onbuild

add the above docker file to the root folder of the application.

This onbuild command will do following things:
will COPY . /usr/src/app, 
RUN pip install, EXPOSE 8000, and 
set the default command to python manage.py runserver


Working on this, will create a basic app and host it using docker.
